        <h4>Wholewheat noodles in a sauce of shiitake mushrooms, tahini and roasted chilli oil: hot enough to put hairs on your chest.</h3>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>250g shiitake mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                <li> 40g gherkins or pickled cucumber, finely chopped </li>
                <li>2 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal, whites and greens separated  </li>
                <li>1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry)</li>
                <li>2 tsp light soy sauce</li>
                <li>200g wholewheat noodles</li>
                <li>200g baby pak choi or similar greens, shredded</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <item>3 tbsp tahini</item>
                <item>3 tbsp light soy sauce</item>
                <item>1 tbsp Sichuan roasted chilli oil, with sediment, plus an extra drizzle to finish </item>
                <item>1 tbsp Chianking black-rice vinegar </item>
            </ul>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>Blitz the mushrooms in a food processor to lentil-size pieces – be careful they don’t turn to soup.</p>
            <p>Put the peppercorns in a dry frying pan on a low heat and toast until fragrant – about four minutes, but be vigilant because they burn easily – then remove and grind. In the same pan, heat the oil on a high flame. When hot, fry the chopped mushrooms, pressing them into a single layer to maximise contact with the pan, for eight to 10 minutes, until dark brown and beginning to crisp up. Add the gherkins, spring onion whites and the ground Sichuan pepper, fry for two minutes, then add the wine and soy, and cook for two minutes more, until dry and crunchy.</p>
            <p>Mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. It will look a little split at first, but just keep mixing until it comes together.</p>
            <p>Cook the noodles in boiling water according to the packet instructions, stirring to separate them, and add the pak choi for the final two minutes. Just before the noodles are done, remove a mugful of the cooking water, then drain and put the noodles and greens in a large bowl. Mix in the sauce, the mushrooms and the reserved cooking water, tablespoon by tablespoon (I needed six), until the noodles are nice and saucy.</p>
            <p>Divide between two plates, sprinkle with the spring onion greens and a drizzle more oil, and serve.</p>
